.SH NAME
arch-update \- An update notifier/applier for Arch Linux that assists you with important pre/post update tasks. 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arch-update
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
An update notifier/applier for Arch Linux that assists you with important pre/post update tasks and that includes a clickeable systray applet for an easy integration with any panel on any DE/WM.
.br
.RB "Optional support for AUR packages update (through " "yay " "or " "paru" "), Flatpak packages update (through " "flatpak" ") and desktop notifications (through " "libnotify" ")."

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
If no option is passed, launch the relevant series of functions to perform a complete and proper update starting by displaying the list of packages available for update, then ask for the user's confirmation to proceed with the installation.
.br
.RB "It also supports AUR packages update (if " "yay " "or " "paru " "is installed) and Flatpak packages update (if " "flatpak " "is installed)."
.br
Before performing the update, it offers to display the latest Arch Linux news to the user. By default, Arch news are only displayed if at least a new one has been published since the last run. Arch news published since the last run or at the same date are tagged as '[NEW]'.
.br
Arch-Update also checks for orphan packages, unused Flatpak packages, old and/or uninstalled cached packages in pacman's cache, pacnew/pacsave files and pending kernel update requiring a reboot to be applied and, if there are, offers to process them.
.br
Those functions are launched when you click on the systray applet.

.SH USAGE
.TP
.B The systray applet
.RB "To start the systray applet automatically at boot, add the " "arch-update --tray " "command to your auto-start commands/WM config or start/enable the associated systemd service like so: " "systemctl \-\-user enable \-\-now arch-update-tray.service"
.br
.RB "The systray icon will automatically change depending on the current state of your system ('up to date' or 'updates available'). When clicked, it launches " "arch-update " "via the " "arch-update.desktop " file.

.RB "The systray applet attempts to read the " "arch-update.desktop " "file at the below paths and in the following order:"

\- $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/arch-update.desktop
.br
\- $HOME/.local/share/applications/arch-update.desktop
.br
\- $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications/arch-update.desktop
.br
\- /usr/local/share/applications/arch-update.desktop <-- Default installation path when installing Arch-Update from source
.br
\- /usr/share/applications/arch-update.desktop <-- Default installation path when installing Arch-Update from the AUR

.RB "In case you want/need to customize the " "arch-update.desktop " "file, copy it in a path that has a higher priority than the default installation path and modify it there (to ensure that your custom " "arch-update.desktop " "file supersedes the default one and that your modifications are not being overwritten on updates)."

.TP
.B The systemd timer
.RB "There is a systemd service in " "/usr/lib/systemd/user/arch-update.service " "(or in " "/etc/systemd/user/arch-update.service " "if you installed arch-update from source) that executes the " "\-\-check " "function when launched. To launch it automatically " "at boot and then once every hour " "enable the associated systemd timer (the auto-check cycle can be modified to your liking. See the TIPS AND TRICKS chapter below):"
.br
.B systemctl \-\-user enable \-\-now arch-update.timer

.RB "If you want to change the check cycle, run " "systemctl --user edit --full arch-update.timer " "and modify the " "OnUnitActiveSec " "value to your liking."
.br
.RB "For instance, if you want " "Arch-Update " "to check for new updates every 10 minutes instead:"
.br

[...]
.br
[Timer]
.br
OnStartupSec=15
.br
.RB "OnUnitActiveSec=" "10m"
.br
[...]
